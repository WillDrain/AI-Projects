# AI-Projects
This repo contains my month 1-6 projects for learning AI engineering 

## Day 1
- Created repo `ai-projects` on GitHub  
- Added initial `README.md` with project overview  
- Wrote first Python script `hello_ai.py` to test setup  
- Verified GitHub workflow (git add, commit, push)

## Day 2
- Practiced NumPy arrays (creation, slicing, reshaping)
- Implemented dot product manually and with NumPy
- Practiced Pandas: read_csv, head(), info(), describe()

## Day 3
- Started **Iris dataset project**: loaded and inspected dataset
- Practiced **data cleaning**: checked for nulls, renamed columns, dropped unnecessary features
- Saved `iris_cleaned.csv` for future ML models
- Learned about **vector norms** and **normalization**
  - ||[3,4]|| = 5
  - Normalized [3,4] = [0.6, 0.8]
